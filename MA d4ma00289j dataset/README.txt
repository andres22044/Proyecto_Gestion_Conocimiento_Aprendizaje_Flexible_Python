METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100, with attenuated total reflectance mode in the region of 4000−650 cm−1. 16 scans were done with a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1H NMR and 13C NMR were performed on a Bruker Avance III HD 600 MHz NMR instrument, with a 5 mm PABBO BB probe. CDCl3 was used as the solvent. Tetramethylsilane was used as the internal standard for 1H NMR. The number of scans were 64 and 4096 for 1H NMR and 13C NMR, respectively.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II GPC with Agilent GPC/SEC software and 2 x PLgel 5 μm MIXED-C columns (polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS/DVB), as well as a PLgel 5 μm guard column at 35 °C and a flow rate of 1.0 
mL.min-1. The eluent used was THF containing 2.0% v/v triethylamine and 0.05% w/v BHT inhibitor. The sample concentration was 3 g.mol1 prepared by mechanical stirring overnight followed by filtering 
through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter. The GPC was calibrated using 12 x EasiVial PS-H (2 mL) standards, with molecular weights equal to 162, 580, 1,210, 4,880, 10,330, 22,790, 75,050, 194,500, 479,200, 885,000, 3,152,000, and 6,570,000 g.mol-1.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Discovery DSC25 instrument under nitrogen flow (at a rate of 50 mL.min−1) with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C.min−1 at temperatures between −90 °C and 190 °C. Two cycles of heating-cooling were performed, and the second cycle was analysed.
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Netzsch TG 209F1 Libra instrument under nitrogen flow (at a rate of 50 mL.min−1) between 25 °C and 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C.min−1. 
Tensile testing was performed on a Lloyds LRX universal testing machine using a 50 N load cell at room temperature (RT) with a crosshead speed of 100 mm.min−1 according to ISO-37. A minimum of four (P35/P40) or three (P45) samples were tested. Cyclic tensile testing was carried out to 100% strain on the same machine at a speed of 20 mm.min-1 with one-minute rest given between cycles. 
A hardness test was conducted with Shore A on a Coats Comaco Rubber Hardness Tester in accordance with ISO-868. The specimens had a minimum thickness of 4 mm. Three separate areas of the samples were tested for each composition. 
To quantify the mechanical self-healing of the TPUs, the materials were evaluated through a cut-heal process. The specimens were cut completely in half using a scalpel blade and then the two damaged surfaces were placed back together by hand for several seconds, followed by another set amount of time of further selfhealing without force. After a given time, the samples underwent uniaxial tensile testing.
Water Contact Angle was measured on a Krüss DSA-100. Three different areas of each sample were tested per composition. A smooth area of the sample had a 20 μl droplet of water placed onto the surface. The angle between the droplet and the surface was then measured.
To prepare mechanical and physical testing samples, the TPU materials synthesised were hot pressed at 120 °C for 5 min on a Randoll electrical press to produce rectangular sheets with a thickness of 2 mm. The dumbbell samples for tensile testing were cut from the sheets using a Ray-Ran punch and an ISO 37 type 3 mould, and small disc samples (1 cm diameter) for hardness and contact angle tests were cut using a 10 mm biopsy punch.
To prepare the stretchable conductors, rectangular samples of dimensions 10 mm x 40 mm for use in conductivity tests, were cut using a cutting press, and the circuits were printed using a Voltero VOne inkjet printer and a silver ink (PerkyPegasus, containing between 70−90 wt% silver and a viscosity of 5000 cP) supplied by Voltero. To test the electrical performance under strain, a Lloyd LRX tensile testing machine was utilised to stretch the device to a strain of 300% at a rate of 5 mm.min-1, while a Keysight 34470A multimeter was used to record the change in resistance by a two-probe method. Two alligator clips were attached to either side of the printed conductive circuit
